        <pre> <!--song lyrics-->
        I just came to my senses (yeah)
        I stay in another dimension
        Fear is non-existent
        Suit up and swing through the city (ooh) (aye)
        Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
        I'm in my own world, give me space
        I'm in my own universe, give me space (yeah)
        Weezy Carter, I'm 'bout to go Peter Parker
        I'm Spider-Man, if he ain't me, he just a creepy crawler
        Tunechi spark the lighter, pull up in a new Ferrari spider
        Spider web necklace with the diamonds
        She'll turn to Spider-Woman if I bite her
        I will not go back and forth with you
        I see you got the black widow with you
        You should've had a black hero with you
        I get an opp-arachnophobia
        I've been litty since I flicked the lighter
        Since I was an itsy bitsy spider
        They've been tryna wash the spider out
        I got spiders crawlin' out your mouth, Spider-Verse
        I just came to my senses (yeah)
        I stay in another dimension
        Fear is non-existent
        Suit up and swing through the city (ooh) (aye)
        Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
        I'm in my own world, give me space
        I'm in my own universe, give me space (yeah)
        I'm focused, I'm focused (focused)
        I'm chosen, I'm golden (golden)
        I'm stronger, on missions, ain't no foldin', a soldier (soldier)
        My vision persistent, I took the game, it's over (it's over)
        I made a name, it's global (it's global), my enemy pass over (hey)
        I took the way to the top, I had to learn to be smart (smart)
        I had to move with my heart, keepin' my eyes on the part
        'Cause it get evil and dark (evil and dark)
        When it come to my opponents
        I know how to beat 'em, I know to defeat 'em (hey)
        Livin' my life by the moment
        Somebody callin', somebody gon' need 'em
        I just came to my senses (yeah)
        I stay in another dimension
        Fear is non-existent
        Suit up and swing through the city (ooh) (aye)
        Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
        I'm in my own world, give me space
        I'm in my own universe, give me space (yeah)
        Okay, we bounce and shake, we roll and rock
        I got to set it straight, the block is hot
        Something's come over me, I hit unlock
        And tell my enemies "I'll never stop"
        No, no, nothing can shake me now, aye
        Tell the block I made it now
        Yeah, the whole town is talking out
        I swear, nothing can stop me now
        All this boosting all my senses
        I won't start, but I finished
        I shoot my shot, bet I won't miss it
        Only way to go is go the distance
        Nothing can shake me now
        Nothing can break me down
        Tell the whole town, we popping now
        Nothing can shake me now
        M.W.A. Music
        This is unbelievable
        This is the lobby
        Oh
        Welcome to Spider Society
